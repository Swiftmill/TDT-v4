# THE DARK TRIAD Portal

This repository contains a fully static, immersive landing page inspired by ccc.actor and themed around **THE DARK TRIAD**. Everything runs locally without any build tooling—simply open `index.html` in a browser.

## Assets

- Replace `assets/video1.txt`, `assets/video2.txt`, and `assets/video3.txt` with your MP4 background videos while keeping the same filenames.
- Replace `assets/logo-dark-triad.txt` with your actual triangle logo saved as `logo-dark-triad.png` (the `.txt` file is just a placeholder so the repository stays text-only).
- Replace `assets/video-placeholder.txt` with your loading poster image saved as `video-placeholder.jpg`. The `.txt` file simply
  documents the required filename.

## Features

- Dynamic glyph system that cycles occult-like symbols and reveals human-readable text on hover/focus.
- Click the logo or the main title to cycle between the three looping background videos with a soft flash transition.
- Atmospheric overlays: animated halo around the logo, scanlines, grain, vignette, and responsive layout tuned for desktop and mobile.

No external dependencies are required—fonts fall back to local Montserrat and Playfair Display if available.
